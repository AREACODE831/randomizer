Destiny -
Do you remember what was the first conversation with your friend or teacher or lover who are with you now?

I often think that coincidences shape the destiny and destiny comes to our life with coincidences.

I will draw or collage the images like walking into the crowd and
The moment of coincidence- destiny.

There is a word in Korea: 인연(In-yeon),  which means and belive that there is a relation, the destiny red lines between person and person.
And I wanted to bring that concept to randomizer.
